- for problem 12, we need more efficient method to calculate the number of divisors for a large integer.

- implement a member function for myInt that generates and stores a list of n prime numbers. 

- code can be based on Problem 7.

- for problem 12, lets generate a list of 500 primes as the list to test against.
